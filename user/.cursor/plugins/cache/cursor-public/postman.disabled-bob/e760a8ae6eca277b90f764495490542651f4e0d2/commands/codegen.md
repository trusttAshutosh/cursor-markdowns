# /postman:codegen -- Generate Client Code

Generate typed client code from Postman collections. Reads your private APIs and writes production-ready client code that matches your project conventions.

## Prerequisites

Postman MCP Server must be configured. If MCP tools fail, tell the user to run `/postman:setup`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Find the API

1. Call `searchPostmanElementsInPrivateNetwork` with the API name to find it in the organization's private network.
2. If no results, call `getWorkspaces` to get the user's workspace ID. If multiple workspaces exist, ask which to use. Then use `getCollections` with the `workspace` parameter and `name` filter if the user specified an API name.
3. If still no results, fall back to `searchPostmanElementsInPublicNetwork` to search the public Postman network.
4. Match by name or ask the user which collection to generate code from.
5. Call `getCollection` (full model) to get the complete collection with all requests, bodies, and params.
6. Call `getSpecDefinition` if a linked spec exists (richer type information).
7. Call `getCodeGenerationInstructions` for the MCP server's recommended codegen workflow.

### Step 2: Understand the API Shape

For the target collection:
1. Call `getCollectionFolder` for each folder to understand resource grouping
2. Call `getCollectionRequest` for each relevant endpoint to get:
   - HTTP method and URL
   - Request headers and auth requirements
   - Request body schema
   - Path and query parameters
3. Call `getCollectionResponse` for each request to get:
   - Response status codes
   - Response body shapes (for typing)
   - Error response formats
4. Call `getEnvironment` to understand base URLs and variables

### Step 3: Detect Project Language

If the user doesn't specify a language, detect it from the project:

| File | Language |
|------|----------|
| `package.json` + `tsconfig.json` | TypeScript |
| `package.json` (no tsconfig) | JavaScript |
| `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` | Python |
| `go.mod` | Go |
| `Cargo.toml` | Rust |
| `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` | Java |
| `*.csproj` | C# |
| `Gemfile` | Ruby |

### Step 4: Generate Code

Generate a client that includes:

- **Typed client class or module** with one method per endpoint
- **Request/response types** from the collection schemas and examples
- **Authentication handling** based on collection auth config (Bearer, API key, OAuth2)
- **Error handling** with typed error responses from documented error schemas
- **Environment-based configuration** (base URL from env vars)
- **Pagination support** if the API uses cursor or offset pagination

The generated code should:
- Match the project's existing conventions (imports, formatting, naming style)
- Include JSDoc, docstrings, or doc comments from collection descriptions
- Use the project's existing HTTP library if one is present (axios, fetch, requests, reqwest, etc.)
- Use proper camelCase/snake_case matching the target language conventions
- Handle query parameters, path parameters, headers, and request bodies correctly

### Step 5: Write and Present

Write the generated code to an appropriate location in the project:
- TypeScript/JavaScript: `src/clients/<api-name>.ts` or `src/lib/<api-name>.ts`
- Python: `src/clients/<api_name>.py` or `<package>/clients/<api_name>.py`
- Go: `pkg/clients/<apiname>.go` or `internal/clients/<apiname>.go`

Present a summary:

```
Generated: src/clients/users-api.ts

  Endpoints covered:
    GET    /users         -> getUsers(filters)
    GET    /users/{id}    -> getUser(id)
    POST   /users         -> createUser(data)
    PUT    /users/{id}    -> updateUser(id, data)
    DELETE /users/{id}    -> deleteUser(id)

  Types generated:
    User, CreateUserRequest, UpdateUserRequest,
    UserListResponse, ApiError

  Auth: Bearer token (from USERS_API_TOKEN env var)
  Base URL: from USERS_API_BASE_URL env var
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Response |
|-------|----------|
| Collection not found | "I didn't find a collection matching that name. Run /postman:search to see what's available." |
| No requests in collection | "This collection is empty. Add requests in Postman first, or use /postman:sync to create from a spec." |
| Can't detect language | "I can't detect the project language. What language should I generate the client in?" |
| Missing auth config | "This collection doesn't specify an auth method. I'll generate the client without auth. You can add it later." |
| Spec not available | "No linked spec found. I'll generate types from the collection's saved examples and request bodies." |
