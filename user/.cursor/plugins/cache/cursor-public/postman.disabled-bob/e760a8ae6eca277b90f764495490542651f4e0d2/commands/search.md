# /postman:search -- Discover APIs

Answer natural language questions about available APIs. Search across your Postman workspaces to find endpoints, understand capabilities, and drill into details.

## Prerequisites

Postman MCP Server must be configured. If MCP tools fail, tell the user to run `/postman:setup`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Search

1. Call `searchPostmanElementsInPrivateNetwork` with the user's query. This searches the organization's private API network and is the **primary** search path.
2. If private network results are sparse or private network search is not available, broaden the search:
   - Call `getWorkspaces` to get the user's workspace ID. If multiple workspaces exist, ask which to use. Then use `getCollections` with the `workspace` parameter. Use the `name` filter to narrow results.
   - Call `getTaggedEntities` to find collections by tag.
3. If the user is looking for a public/third-party API (e.g., Stripe, GitHub, Twilio), call `searchPostmanElementsInPublicNetwork` with the user's query.

**Important:** Default to `searchPostmanElementsInPrivateNetwork` for trusted APIs in user's organisation. Only use `searchPostmanElementsInPublicNetwork` when the user explicitly wants public/third-party APIs or private search returns no results.

### Step 2: Drill Into Results

For each relevant match:
1. Call `getCollection` to get the overview
2. Scan endpoint names and descriptions for relevance
3. Call `getCollectionRequest` for the most relevant endpoints to get full details
4. Call `getCollectionResponse` to show what data is returned

### Step 3: Present Results

Format results as a clear answer to the user's question. Answer first, source second.

**When the answer is found:**
```
Yes, you can get a user's email via the API.

  Endpoint: GET /users/{id}
  Collection: "User Management API"
  Auth: Bearer token required

  Response includes:
    {
      "id": "usr_123",
      "email": "jane@example.com",
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "role": "admin",
      "created_at": "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    }

  Want me to generate a client for this API? (/postman:codegen)
```

**When the answer is not found:**
```
I didn't find an endpoint that returns user emails.

  Closest matches:
  - GET /users/{id}/profile -- returns name, avatar, but no email
  - GET /users -- list endpoint, doesn't include email in summary view

  The email field might be behind a different permission scope,
  or it might not be exposed via API yet.
```

**When listing capabilities:**
```
Found 3 collections related to "payments":

  1. Payment Gateway API (22 requests)
     - POST /charges -- Create a charge
     - GET /charges/{id} -- Get charge details
     - POST /refunds -- Issue a refund
     ... and 19 more

  2. Subscription API (14 requests)
     - POST /subscriptions -- Create subscription
     - GET /invoices -- List invoices
     ... and 12 more

  3. Billing Admin API (8 requests)
     - GET /revenue/summary -- Revenue dashboard
     ... and 7 more

  Want details on any of these? Or /postman:codegen to generate a client.
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Response |
|-------|----------|
| No results found | "Nothing matched in your private API network. Try different keywords, browse workspace collections with `getCollections`, or search the public Postman network." |
| Empty workspace | "This workspace has no collections. Use /postman:sync to create one from an API spec." |
| Auth failure | "Postman returned 401. Your API key may be expired. Run /postman:setup to reconfigure." |
