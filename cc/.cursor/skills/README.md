## Layout

- **Canonical path:** `Desktop/novopay/.cursor/skills/`
- **CC repo:** `novopay-platform-creditcard-management/.cursor/skills` is a **junction** to this folder (same files on disk).

When adding or editing a skill, change files **only here**. Do not maintain a second copy in service repos.
